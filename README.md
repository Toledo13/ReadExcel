This Spring Boot program is a Java 17 application designed to read Excel files (.xlsx) from the local filesystem folder. It utilizes the Apache POI library to process Excel files and extract data from them.
Upon startup, the program scans the pre-configured local folder for files with the .xlsx extension. It processes each discovered file, extracts the data, and makes it available for internal use or for display in a web interface, depending on the setup.
This program can be run as a standalone service that periodically checks the local folder for new Excel files to process. It can be useful in scenarios where automated reading and processing of locally stored Excel data is required.
Spring Boot simplifies the development and deployment of this application, providing a robust and easy-to-configure runtime environment.
